SAP ERP Essentials – Notes
1. Introduction
* SAP ERP = Integrated system for large businesses to manage major functions.
* Eliminates data silos, standardizes data, and automates processes.
* Benefits:
   * Real-time reporting → better decisions.
   * Automates core processes (e.g., auto reordering inventory).
   * Strong focus on security and compliance.
* Limitations:
   * High cost of ownership (TCO).
   * Long implementation (6 months–5 years).
   * Steep learning curve → requires training.
   * Resistance to change in organizations.


2. SAP Implementation Steps
1. Project Preparation – Define scope, cost, resources, study current systems.
2. Realization – Configure SAP to match company processes.
   * Configuration = Using SAP default features.
   * Customization = Adding features not in default SAP (costly & time-consuming).
3. Testing
   * Unit testing – individual parts.
   * Integration testing – how modules work together.
   * Performance testing – speed and handling capacity.
4. Final Preparation – Upload master data, set security rules, user training.
5. Go Live – Switch from old systems to SAP.
6. Post Go Live Support – Fix issues, add non-critical customizations.


3. SAP Modules
Two main types:
* Technical Modules – Backend infrastructure, rarely seen by end-users.
* Functional Modules – Directly support business processes.
Common Functional Modules
* Finance (FI) – General ledger, AP, AR, Asset Accounting, Bank Management.
* Controlling (CO) – Cost control, profit centers, product costing.
* Sales & Distribution (SD) – Sales cycle, shipping, billing.
* Materials Management (MM) – Procurement, inventory, vendor data.
* Production Planning (PP) – Manufacturing planning, BOM, capacity planning.
* Quality Management (QM) – Quality inspections, defect tracking.
* Plant Maintenance (PM) – Maintenance scheduling and repair tracking.
* Project Systems (PS) – Project planning and tracking with WBS.
* Human Capital Management (HCM) – HR processes: hiring, payroll, training.


4. Master Data vs Transactional Data
* Master Data – Static foundational info (e.g., customers, vendors, employees).
* Transactional Data – Day-to-day changing activities (e.g., sales orders).


5. Clients in SAP
* Production Client – Live data for daily operations.
* Quality Assurance Client – Testing customizations.
* Sandbox Client – Experimentation area.
* Training Client – For user training.


6. Security Roles
* Controls user access to transactions and organizational levels.
* Ensures Segregation of Duties:
   * E.g., A manager can approve leave for their team but cannot approve for other departments or extend credit to customers.


7. Navigation Basics
* SAP GUI – Interface to access SAP.
* Transactions:
   * Access via Menu Tree or T-Codes.
   * T-Codes ending with:
      * 01 → Create
      * 02 → Change
      * 03 → Display
      * Starting with Z → Custom transaction.
* Shortcuts:
   * /n – New transaction in same session.
   * /o – Open transaction in a new session.


8. Reporting & Exports
* Reports can be customized using:
   * Selection Criteria → filter data before running reports.
   * Variants → save search criteria for repeated use.
   * Layouts → customize report display.
* Export Options:
   * PDF
   * Excel (most common for detailed analysis).


9. Key Processes by Module
Finance (FI):
* AP (Accounts Payable): Vendor invoices, payments, reporting.
* AR (Accounts Receivable): Customer transactions, invoices.
* Asset Accounting: Track acquisitions, depreciation, disposal.
* Bank Accounting: Manage bank transactions.
Controlling (CO):
* Profit Centers: Measure profit/loss by business area.
* Cost Centers: Track expenses by department.
* Internal Orders: One-time expense tracking.
* Product Costing: Manufacturing cost analysis.
* Profitability Analysis: Pricing and region-based profit reports.
Materials Management (MM):
* Purchasing → Requisitions, purchase orders.
* Inventory Management → Goods movement and transfers.
* Physical Inventory → Cycle counts, stock validation.
* Master Data → Material & Vendor details.
Production Planning (PP):
* BOM (Bill of Materials): List of raw materials & components.
* Routings: Step-by-step production operations.
* Capacity Planning: Balance workload.
* MRP (Material Requirement Planning): Ensure raw material availability.


10. Tips for Beginners
* Use Favorites folder for frequently used T-Codes.
* Enable tooltips and display technical names for easier navigation.
* Save layouts and search variants to speed up reporting.

* Wildcards (*) are helpful when searching without full names.
