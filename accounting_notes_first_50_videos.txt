==========================================

------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION TO ACCOUNTING
------------------------------------------
Definition:
Accounting is the process of systematically identifying, recording, classifying, summarizing, and interpreting business transactions 
to provide useful information to decision-makers.

Objectives of Accounting:
- Record financial transactions accurately.
- Determine the financial position (assets, liabilities, equity).
- Calculate profit or loss for a specific period.
- Assist in decision-making, budgeting, and planning.
- Ensure legal compliance (taxes, audits).

Branches of Accounting:
1. Financial Accounting – Preparation of financial statements for external users.
2. Cost Accounting – Calculation and control of production costs.
3. Management Accounting – Providing data to internal management for decision-making.
4. Tax Accounting – Focus on tax compliance and reporting.

Accounting Equation:
The foundation of accounting.
ASSETS = LIABILITIES + OWNER’S EQUITY

Explanation:
- **Assets** = What the business owns (cash, buildings, inventory).
- **Liabilities** = What the business owes (loans, creditors).
- **Equity** = Owner’s stake in the business (capital + retained earnings).

Example:
If a business has Cash = 50,000, Inventory = 20,000, Loans = 30,000:
Total Assets = 70,000
Equity = 70,000 - 30,000 = 40,000

------------------------------------------
2. RECORDING TRANSACTIONS
------------------------------------------
Every transaction has two effects: **Debit (Dr)** and **Credit (Cr)**.

Golden Rules of Accounting:
1. Personal Accounts:
   - Debit the receiver, Credit the giver.
2. Real Accounts:
   - Debit what comes in, Credit what goes out.
3. Nominal Accounts:
   - Debit all expenses and losses, Credit all incomes and gains.

Journal Entry Format:
Date | Particulars | Debit (Dr) | Credit (Cr)

Example:
Paid salary of $5,000
Salary A/C (Dr) 5,000
   To Cash A/C 5,000

Purpose of Journals:
- Maintain a chronological record of transactions.
- Foundation for ledger posting and financial statements.

------------------------------------------
3. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------
Two main statements:
1. **Profit & Loss Statement (P&L)** – Measures performance.
   Net Profit = Revenue - (COGS + Expenses + Taxes)

2. **Balance Sheet** – Snapshot of financial position.
   Assets = Liabilities + Equity

P&L Structure:
Revenue
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses
= Operating Profit
- Taxes/Other Charges
= Net Profit

Balance Sheet Sections:
Assets:
- Current Assets (cash, inventory, accounts receivable)
- Non-Current Assets (property, equipment, vehicles)

Liabilities:
- Current Liabilities (due within one year)
- Non-current Liabilities (long-term loans)

------------------------------------------
4. CLASSIFYING ACCOUNTS
------------------------------------------
Types of Accounts:
- **Assets** – Resources owned by business.
  Examples: Cash, equipment, inventory.

- **Liabilities** – Obligations owed by business.
  Examples: Bank loan, accounts payable.

- **Equity/Capital** – Owner's residual interest.
  Example: Owner's capital, retained earnings.

- **Income** – Revenue generated by business operations.
  Example: Sales revenue, service income.

- **Expenses** – Costs incurred to generate revenue.
  Example: Rent, salaries, utilities.

------------------------------------------
5. BANK RECONCILIATION
------------------------------------------
Purpose:
To reconcile the difference between the cash balance in company records and the bank statement.

Common Causes of Differences:
- Cheques issued but not yet cleared.
- Deposits in transit.
- Bank charges or interest not recorded.
- Errors in recording.

Steps:
1. Compare bank statement with cash book.
2. Adjust for unrecorded transactions.
3. Prepare a reconciliation statement.

------------------------------------------
6. CREDIT TRANSACTIONS
------------------------------------------
Accounts Receivable:
- Represents money owed to the business by customers.
- Recorded as a **current asset**.

Accounts Payable:
- Represents money the business owes to suppliers.
- Recorded as a **current liability**.

Example:
Goods sold on credit for $10,000:
Accounts Receivable (Dr) 10,000
   To Sales (Cr) 10,000

Payment received later:
Cash (Dr) 10,000
   To Accounts Receivable (Cr) 10,000

------------------------------------------
7. EXPENSES AND PAYABLES
------------------------------------------
- **Expenses** are recorded when incurred, NOT when paid (accrual principle).
- Types:
  - Operating Expenses (rent, utilities)
  - Non-operating Expenses (interest, taxes)

Example:
Received electricity bill of $2,000 but unpaid:
Electricity Expense (Dr) 2,000
   To Accounts Payable (Cr) 2,000

When paid:
Accounts Payable (Dr) 2,000
   To Cash (Cr) 2,000

------------------------------------------
8. INCOME AND RECEIVABLES
------------------------------------------
Income Recognition:
- Income is recorded when **earned**, not when cash is received.

Bad Debts:
- Occur when a customer cannot pay the owed amount.
- Recorded as an expense.

Doubtful Debts:
- Estimated amount of receivables that may become bad debts.
- Recorded by creating an allowance.

Journal Example:
Bad Debt Expense (Dr) 1,000
   To Accounts Receivable (Cr) 1,000

------------------------------------------
9. SALES TAX
------------------------------------------
Sales Tax:
- A tax charged on the sale of goods/services.
- Businesses collect tax on behalf of the government.

Example:
Sold goods worth $10,000 with 10% tax:
Accounts Receivable (Dr) 11,000
   To Sales (Cr) 10,000
   To Sales Tax Payable (Cr) 1,000

------------------------------------------
10. ACCRUALS AND PREPAYMENTS
------------------------------------------
Accruals:
- Expenses incurred but not yet paid.
- Example: Unpaid salary for December.

Journal Entry:
Salary Expense (Dr) 5,000
   To Salary Payable (Cr) 5,000

Prepayments:
- Expenses paid in advance.
- Example: Rent paid for next 6 months.

Journal Entry:
Prepaid Rent (Dr) 12,000
   To Cash (Cr) 12,000

------------------------------------------
11. NON-CURRENT ASSETS
------------------------------------------
Types:
1. Tangible – Physical assets like machinery, land.
2. Intangible – Non-physical assets like patents, goodwill.

Depreciation:
- Allocation of the cost of a fixed asset over its useful life.

Formula:
Depreciation = (Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life

Example:
Machinery worth $50,000, residual $5,000, life 5 years:
Depreciation = (50,000 - 5,000) / 5 = 9,000 per year

------------------------------------------
12. INVENTORY ACCOUNTING
------------------------------------------
Methods:
1. FIFO (First In, First Out) – Oldest inventory sold first.
2. LIFO (Last In, First Out) – Newest inventory sold first.
3. Weighted Average Cost – Average cost per unit.

Formula for COGS:
COGS = Opening Stock + Purchases - Closing Stock

------------------------------------------
13. EQUITY ACCOUNTING
------------------------------------------
Equity = Capital invested + Retained earnings - Drawings

Shares:
- Common shares represent ownership.
- Preferred shares have priority for dividends.

Dividends:
- Profit distributed to shareholders.

Journal Entry:
Retained Earnings (Dr)
   To Dividend Payable (Cr)

------------------------------------------
14. LEASES
------------------------------------------
Types of Leases:
1. Operating Lease – Treated as rental expense.
2. Finance Lease – Lessee treated as owner.

------------------------------------------
15. FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNTING

Ratios:

------------------------------------------
