ACCOUNTING CRASH COURSE SUMMARY

1. BASICS OF ACCOUNTING
- Accounting = Language of business; records every transaction.
- Every transaction has two sides: Debit (Dr) & Credit (Cr). Debit = Credit always.

Golden Rules:
- Assets & Expenses: Increase → Debit | Decrease → Credit
- Liabilities, Equity, Income: Increase → Credit | Decrease → Debit

2. KEY ELEMENTS
1) Assets – What company owns for future benefit.
   Examples: Cash, Inventory, Building, Equipment, Accounts Receivable.
   - Current Assets: Converted to cash within 12 months.
   - Non-Current Assets: Long-term (Land, Machinery).
   - Intangible Assets: Patents, Goodwill, Software.

2) Liabilities – What company owes.
   - Current Liabilities: Due within 12 months.
   - Non-Current Liabilities: Long-term debts.
   - Contingent Liabilities: Dependent on future events (lawsuits, warranties).

3) Equity – Owner’s claim after liabilities.
   Formula: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

4) Income – Increases assets or decreases liabilities → increases profit.
   Examples: Sales, Service Income, Dividend Income.

5) Expenses – Decrease assets or increase liabilities → decreases profit.
   Examples: Salaries, Rent, Utilities, Depreciation.

3. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- Balance Sheet (Snapshot): Shows Assets, Liabilities, Equity.
- Income Statement (Period): Income – Expenses = Net Profit/Loss.
- Cash Flow Statement: Cash movement divided into
  * Operating Activities
  * Investing Activities
  * Financing Activities

4. KEY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
- Accrual: Record when transactions occur, not when cash moves.
- Matching: Match revenue with related expenses.
- Historical Cost: Record assets at purchase price.
- Going Concern: Assume business will continue.
- Materiality: Ignore small insignificant amounts.
- Revenue Recognition: Record revenue when goods/services delivered.
- Consistency: Use same accounting policies each year unless necessary to change.
