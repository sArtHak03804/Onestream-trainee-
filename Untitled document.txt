SECTION 3: UNDERSTANDING PROFIT & LOSS STATEMENT
-------------------------------------
Definition:
A Profit & Loss Statement (P&L), also known as Income Statement, 
shows the financial performance of a business over a specific period of time.
It reveals whether the business made a PROFIT or a LOSS.


Structure of a P&L Statement:
1. Revenue (Sales, service income)
2. LESS: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
3. = Gross Profit
4. LESS: Operating Expenses (salaries, rent, utilities, marketing)
5. = Operating Profit
6. LESS: Taxes, interest, other costs
7. = Net Profit or Net Loss


Key Formula:
Net Profit = Total Revenue - (COGS + Operating Expenses + Taxes)


Example:
Sales Revenue = 50,000
COGS = 20,000
Operating Expenses = 15,000
Net Profit = 50,000 - (20,000 + 15,000) = 15,000


Importance of P&L Statement:
1. Helps measure business performance.
2. Identifies high expense areas.
3. Helps investors and creditors assess profitability.


-------------------------------------
SECTION 4: OWNER'S CAPITAL & BALANCE SHEET
-------------------------------------
Owner's Capital:
- Represents total funds invested by the owner into the business.
- Affected by:
  a) Increase in capital:
     - Initial capital invested
     - Additional capital invested
     - Net profit retained in business
  b) Decrease in capital:
     - Losses
     - Drawings (cash or goods withdrawn by owner)


Formula:
Ending Capital = Beginning Capital + Additional Capital + Profit - Drawings


Balance Sheet:
- A financial statement that shows the company’s financial position on a specific date.
- Based on the ACCOUNTING EQUATION:
  Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity


Structure of Balance Sheet:
-------------------------------------
ASSETS            | LIABILITIES & EQUITY
-------------------------------------
Cash              | Accounts Payable
Accounts Receivable | Loans Payable
Inventory         | Owner's Capital
Equipment         | 
-------------------------------------


Types of Assets:
1. Current Assets – Easily converted into cash within one year (cash, inventory, accounts receivable).
2. Fixed/Non-current Assets – Used for long-term operations (machinery, buildings).


Types of Liabilities:
1. Current Liabilities – Due within one year (creditors, short-term loans).
2. Long-term Liabilities – Payable after one year (mortgages, bonds).


Example of Accounting Equation:
If a business has:
- Total Assets = 80,000
- Total Liabilities = 50,000
Then,
Owner's Equity = Assets - Liabilities = 80,000 - 50,000 = 30,000


-------------------------------------
IMPORTANT FORMULAS (Quick Recap)
-------------------------------------
1. Net Profit = Revenue - (COGS + Expenses)
2. Accounting Equation = Assets = Liabilities + Equity
3. Owner's Ending Capital = Initial Capital + Profit - Drawings
